        Hello There, <BR>
        I see you are reading my message. Well, Good Job. I wrote this message to challange you to "The Loop". The challange is simple, you just need to find a secret meaningful set of words (a sentence) hidden in this webpage. The sentence contains 6 words. <BR>
        While solving this, you need to follow 6 rules which are as follows:- <BR>
    </p>
        <OL>
            <LI>You must follow all the rules including this one.</LI>
            <LI>You must not follow the rules.</LI>
            <LI>Not too many people will follow the rules.</LI>
            <LI>Some of the people will get MAD at me.</LI>
            <LI>You are requested to follow all the rules.</LI>
            <LI>Only smart people will follow the rules.</LI>
        </OL>
    
    <p>
        Well, <BR>
        Hope we meet again! <BR>
    </p>
